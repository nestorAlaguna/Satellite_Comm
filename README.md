# Optical Satellite Communications Digital Twin

A comprehensive Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) simulation of optical satellite communication systems, integrating orbital mechanics, link budget analysis, and machine learning for predictive maintenance.

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital twin for optical satellite communication systems, demonstrating:

- **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** principles using Python
- **Optical communication physics** with realistic link budget calculations
- **Orbital mechanics** integration using real satellite data (TLEs)
- **Machine Learning** for signal fade prediction and system optimization
- **Professional data visualization** and system performance analysis

## System Architecture

The digital twin models the complete satellite communication chain:

- **Satellite Blocks**: Optical communication payloads with transmit power, antenna gain, and orbital parameters
- **Ground Station Blocks**: Optical receivers with telescope apertures and location constraints
- **Optical Link Model**: Physics-based link budget calculation including free-space path loss, atmospheric effects, and bit error rate analysis
- **Orbital Simulation**: Real-time satellite position tracking and visibility analysis
- **ML Prediction**: Adaptive fade prediction using historical telemetry data
